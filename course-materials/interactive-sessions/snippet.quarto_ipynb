        "#### Explanation of Each Format and Key Options:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **PNG (Portable Network Graphics)**\n",
        "   - **Code:** `plt.savefig(\"sample_plot.png\", dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')`\n",
        "   - **Usage:** PNG is a lossless image format ideal for high-quality graphics and images with transparency.\n",
        "   - **Options:**\n",
        "     - **dpi:** Dots per inch, controls the resolution. Higher values produce higher-quality images. `dpi=300` is common for publication-quality images.\n",
        "     - **bbox_inches='tight':** Trims the whitespace around the figure, ensuring a tight layout.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)**\n",
        "   - **Code:** `plt.savefig(\"sample_plot.jpg\", dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')`\n",
        "   - **Usage:** JPEG is a lossy compression format best suited for photographs. It is not ideal for images with sharp edges or text. The  compression used by matplotlib is 75 on a scale from 0-100 (100 is best quality, least compression)\n",
        "   - **Options:**\n",
        "     - **dpi:** Resolution, same as with PNG.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **PDF (Portable Document Format)**\n",
        "   - **Code:** `plt.savefig(\"sample_plot.pdf\", bbox_inches='tight')`\n",
        "   - **Usage:** PDF is a vector format, ideal for documents and scalable graphics. It preserves quality at any zoom level. For this reason, it can create very large files if you are exporting an image with thousands to millions of points, so be careful!\n",
        "   - **Options:**\n",
        "     - **bbox_inches='tight':** Ensures a tight layout without unnecessary whitespace.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)**\n",
        "   - **Code:** `plt.savefig(\"sample_plot.svg\", bbox_inches='tight')`\n",
        "   - **Usage:** SVG is a vector format that is widely used on the web. It's easier to edit than a PDF, and itâ€™s ideal for smaller-sized graphics that need to scale without losing quality. It will generally make figures that are larger than PDFs, so this format is not a good choice for complicated plots!\n",
        "   - **Options:**\n",
        "     - **bbox_inches='tight':** Again, this option is useful to ensure a tight layout.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)**\n",
        "   - **Code:** `plt.savefig(\"sample_plot.tiff\", dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')`\n",
        "   - **Usage:** TIFF is a lossless format often used in professional environments, especially for printing and scanning.\n",
        "   - **Options:**\n",
        "     - **dpi:** Higher DPI settings ensure better quality, especially important for print.\n"
