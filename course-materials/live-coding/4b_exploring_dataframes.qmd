## Overview

In this 45-minute session, we will explore the basics of pandas DataFrames - a fundamental data structure for data manipulation and analysis in Python. We'll focus on essential operations that form the foundation of working with DataFrames.

## Objectives

- Understand the structure and basic properties of pandas DataFrames.
- Learn how to create and load DataFrames.
- Apply methods for data selection and filtering.
- Perform basic data manipulation and analysis using DataFrames.

## Getting Started (5 minutes)

1. **Prepare Your Environment**:
   - Open JupyterLab and create a new notebook named "pandas_dataframes_intro".
   - Download the sample dataset from [here](link_to_dataset).

2. **Participation**:
   - Code along with me during the session.
   - Ask questions as we go - if you're wondering about something, others probably are too!

## Session Outline

### 1. Introduction to pandas DataFrames (5 minutes)
- What are DataFrames?
- Importing pandas and creating a simple DataFrame

### 2. Loading and Exploring Data (10 minutes)
- Reading a CSV file into a DataFrame
- Basic DataFrame attributes and methods (shape, info, describe, head)

### 3. Data Selection and Filtering (10 minutes)
- Selecting columns and rows
- Boolean indexing

### 4. Basic Data Manipulation (10 minutes)
- Adding and removing columns
- Handling missing data

### 5. Q&A and Wrap-up (5 minutes)
- Address any questions
- Recap key points

## Code Examples We'll Cover

```python
import pandas as pd

# Creating a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': ['a', 'b', 'c']})

# Loading data from CSV
df = pd.read_csv('sample_data.csv')

# Basic exploration
print(df.shape)
df.info()
print(df.describe())

# Selection and filtering
selected_columns = df[['column1', 'column2']]
filtered_rows = df[df['column1'] > 5]

# Data manipulation
df['new_column'] = df['column1'] * 2
df.dropna(inplace=True)
```

## After the Session

- Review your notes and try to replicate the exercises on your own.
- Experiment with the code using your own datasets.
- Check out our class [DataFrame cheatsheet](../cheatsheets/pandas_dataframes.qmd) for quick reference.
- For more advanced features, explore the [official pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/).
