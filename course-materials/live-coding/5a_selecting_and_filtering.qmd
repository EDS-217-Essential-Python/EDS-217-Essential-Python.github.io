*A line of pandas, where each panda is dressed similar to the others, but one thing about them is different. For example, one panda has a different pattern on his shirt, while another has the same pattern, but in a different color. One is wearing a blue hat and the other is wearing a green hat in the same style. A third panda is wearing a green hat, but it is in a different style.* [MidJourney 5](https://www.midjourney.com/jobs/ac303c56-18a0-465d-8d2e-d0fcbe7575be?index=0)

## Overview

In this session, we will be exploring how to select and filter data from DataFrames.

## Objectives

- Apply various indexing methods to select rows and columns in dataframes.
- Use boolean logic to filter data based on values
- Develop the ability to troubleshoot and debug in a live setting.

## Getting Started

We will be using the data stored in the csv at this url:
```{python}
url = ''
```
To get the most out of this session, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Prepare Your Environment**:
   - Make sure JupyterLab is up and running on your machine.
   - Open a new Jupyter notebook where you can write your own code as we go along.
   - Make sure to name the notebook something informative so you can refer back to it later.

2. **Participation**:
   - Try to code along with me during the session.
   - Feel free to ask questions at any time. Remember, if you have a question, others probably do too!

3. **Resources**:
   - I will be sharing snippets of code and notes. Make sure to take your own notes and save snippets in your notebook for future reference.

## Session Format

### Introduction

- Brief discussion about the topic and its importance in data science.

### Demonstration

- I will demonstrate code examples live. Follow along and write the code into your own Jupyter notebook.

### Practice

- You will have the opportunity to try exercises on your own to apply what you've learned.

### Q&A

- We will have a Q&A session at the end where you can ask specific questions about the code, concepts, or issues encountered during the session.

## After the Session

- Review your notes and try to replicate the exercises on your own.

- Experiment with the code by modifying parameters or adding new features to deepen your understanding.

- Check out our class data [selection and filtering](../cheatsheets/data_selection.qmd) cheatsheet.
