## Overview

In this session, we will be exploring data import using the `read_csv()` function in pandas. Live coding is a great way to learn programming as it allows you to see the process of writing code in real-time, including how to deal with unexpected issues and debug errors.

## Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of flow control in Python.
- Use `read_csv()` options to handle different .csv file structures.
- Learn how to parse dates and handle missing data during import.
- Learn how to filter columns and handle large files.

Develop the ability to troubleshoot and debug in a live setting.

## Getting Started

To get the most out of this session, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Prepare Your Environment**:
   - Make sure JupyterLab is up and running on your machine.
   - Open a new Jupyter notebook where you can write your own code as we go along.
   - Make sure to name the notebook something informative so you can refer back to it later.

2. **Participation**:
   - Try to code along with me during the session.
   - Feel free to ask questions at any time. Remember, if you have a question, others probably do too!

3. **Resources**:
   - I will be sharing snippets of code and notes. Make sure to take your own notes and save snippets in your notebook for future reference.

## Session Format

### Introduction

- Brief discussion about the topic and its importance in data science.

### Demonstration

- I will demonstrate code examples live. Follow along and write the code into your own Jupyter notebook.

### Practice

- You will have the opportunity to try exercises on your own to apply what you've learned.

### Q&A

- We will have a Q&A session at the end where you can ask specific questions about the code, concepts, or issues encountered during the session.

## After the Session

- Review your notes and try to replicate the exercises on your own.

- Experiment with the code by modifying parameters or adding new features to deepen your understanding.

- Check out our class [read_csv()](../cheatsheets/read_csv.qmd) cheatsheet.
