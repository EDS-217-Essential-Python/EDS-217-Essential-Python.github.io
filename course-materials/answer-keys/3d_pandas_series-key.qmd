## Introduction

In this collaborative coding exercise, we'll explore Pandas Series, a fundamental data structure in the Pandas library. You'll work together to create, manipulate, and analyze Series objects.

## Resources

Here's our course cheatsheet on pandas `Series`:

- [Pandas Series Cheatsheet](../cheatsheets/pandas_series.qmd)

Feel free to refer to this cheatsheet throughout the exercise if you need a quick reminder about syntax or functionality.

## Setup

First, let's import the necessary libraries and create a sample Series.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Create a sample Series
fruits = pd.Series(['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry'], name='Fruits')
print(fruits)
```

## Exercise 1: Creating a Series

Work together to create a Series representing the prices of the fruits in our `fruits` Series. Use these values:

> apple: $0.5, banana: $0.3, cherry: $1.0, date: $1.5, elderberry: $2.0


```{python}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
#| 
# Create a Series called 'prices' with the same index as 'fruits'
# Use these prices: apple: $0.5, banana: $0.3, cherry: $1.0, date: $1.5, elderberry: $2.0
prices = pd.Series([0.5, 0.3, 1.0, 2.5, 3.0], index=fruits.values, name='Prices')
print(prices)
```


## Exercise 2: Series Operations

Collaborate to perform the following operations:

1. Calculate the total price of all fruits.
2. Find the most expensive fruit.
3. Apply a 10% discount to all fruits priced over 1.0.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| include: true

# 1. Calculate the total price of all fruits
total_price = prices.sum()

# 2. Find the most expensive fruit
most_expensive = prices.idxmax()

# 3. Apply a 10% discount to all fruits priced over $1.0
discounted_prices = prices.where(prices >= 1.0, prices * 0.9)

print(f"Total price: ${total_price:.2f}")
print(f"Most expensive fruit: {most_expensive}")
print("\nDiscounted prices:")
print(discounted_prices)
```


## Exercise 3: Series Analysis

Work as a team to answer the following questions:

1. What is the average price of the fruits?
2. How many fruits cost less than $1.0?
3. What is the price range (difference between max and min prices)?

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| include: true

# 1. Calculate the average price of the fruits
average_price = prices.mean()

# 2. Count how many fruits cost less than $1.0
cheap_fruits = prices[prices < 1.0].count()

# 3. Calculate the price range (difference between max and min prices)
price_range = prices.max() - prices.min()

print(f"Average price: ${average_price:.2f}")
print(f"Number of fruits under $1.0: {cheap_fruits}")
print(f"Price range: ${price_range:.2f}")
```

## Exercise 4: Series Manipulation

Collaborate to perform these manipulations on the `fruits` and `prices` Series:

1. Add a new fruit 'fig' with a price of $1.2 to both Series using pd.concat
2. Remove 'banana' from both Series.
3. Sort both Series by fruit name (alphabetically).

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| include: true

# 1. Add 'fig' to both Series (price: $1.2)
fruits = pd.concat([fruits, pd.Series(['fig'], name='Fruits')])
prices = pd.concat([prices, pd.Series([1.2], index=['fig'], name='Prices')])

# 2. Remove 'banana' from both Series
fruits = fruits[fruits != 'banana']
prices = prices.drop('banana')

# 3. Sort both Series alphabetically by fruit name
fruits = fruits.sort_values()
prices = prices.reindex(fruits.index)

print("Updated fruits Series:")
print(fruits)
print("\nUpdated prices Series:")
print(prices)
```

## Conclusion

In this collaborative exercise, you've practiced creating, manipulating, and analyzing Pandas Series. You've learned how to perform basic operations, apply conditions, and modify Series objects. These skills will be valuable as you work with more complex datasets in the future.

## Discussion Questions

1. What advantages does using a Pandas Series offer compared to using a Python list or dictionary?
2. Can you think of a real-world scenario where you might use a Pandas Series instead of a DataFrame?
3. What challenges did you face while working with Series in this exercise, and how did you overcome them?

Discuss these questions with your team and share your insights.
