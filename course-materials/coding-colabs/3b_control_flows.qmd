## Quick Reference

Here's a quick reference for the basic control flow structures we'll be using:

```python
# If statement
if condition:
    # code to run if condition is True

# For loop
for item in sequence:
    # code to run for each item

# While loop
while condition:
    # code to run while condition is True
```
Here's our course cheatsheet on control flows:

- [Control Flows Cheatsheet](../cheatsheets/control_flows.qmd)

Feel free to refer to this cheatsheet throughout the exercise if you need a quick reminder about syntax or functionality.


## Exercise Overview

In this Coding Colab, you'll practice using basic control flow structures in Python. Work through these simple tasks with your partner, discussing your approach as you go.

## Part 1: If Statements (20 minutes)

### Task 1: Simple Weather Advice

Write a program that gives weather advice based on temperature:

1. Set a variable `temperature = 20`
2. Use an if-else statement to print advice:
   - If temperature is above 25, print "It's a hot day, stay hydrated!"
   - Otherwise, print "Enjoy the pleasant weather!"

```python
temperature = 20

# Your code here
# Use an if-else statement to print weather advice
```

### Task 2: Grade Classifier

Create a program that assigns a letter grade based on a numerical score:

1. Set a variable `score = 85`
2. Use if-elif-else statements to print the letter grade:
   - 90 or above: "A"
   - 80-89: "B"
   - 70-79: "C"
   - 60-69: "D"
   - Below 60: "F"

```python
score = 85

# Your code here
# Use if-elif-else statements to print the letter grade
```

## Part 2: For Loops (20 minutes)

### Task 3: Counting Sheep

Write a program that counts from 1 to 5, printing "sheep" after each number:

1. Use a for loop with the range() function
2. Print each number followed by "sheep"

```python
# Your code here
# Use a for loop to count sheep
```

### Task 4: Sum of Numbers

Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10:

1. Create a variable `total = 0`
2. Use a for loop with the range() function to add each number to `total`
3. After the loop, print the total

```python
total = 0

# Your code here
# Use a for loop to calculate the sum
```

## Part 3: While Loops (15 minutes)

### Task 5: Countdown

Create a simple countdown program:

1. Set a variable `countdown = 5`
2. Use a while loop to print the countdown from 5 to 1
3. After each print, decrease the countdown by 1
4. When the countdown reaches 0, print "Blast off!"

```python
countdown = 5

# Your code here
# Use a while loop for the countdown
```

## Conclusion and Discussion (5 minutes)

With your partner, briefly discuss:

1. Which control structure (if, for, or while) did you find easiest to use?
2. Can you think of a real-life situation where you might use each of these control structures?

Remember, it's okay if you don't finish all tasks. The goal is to practice and understand these concepts. Good luck and enjoy coding together!
