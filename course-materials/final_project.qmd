## DIY Python Data ScienceWorkflow

In this final class activity, you will work in small groups (2-3) to develop a example data science workflow. 

1. Import Data
2. Explore Data
3. Clean Data
4. Filter Data
5. Sort Data
6. Transform Data
7. Group Data
8. Aggregate Data
9. Visualize Data

## What to do

To conduct this exercise, you should find a suitable dataset; it doesn't need to be environmental data per se - be creative in your search! You should also focus on making a number of exploratory and analysis visualizations using seaborn. You should avoid planning any analysis that absolutely require mapping and focus on using only pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries.

Your final product will be a self-contained notebook that is well-documented with markdown and code comments that you will walk through as a presentation to the rest of the class on the final day. 

Your notebook should include each of the nine steps, even if you don't need to do much in each of them.

You can include visualizations as part of your data exploration (step 2), or anywhere else it is helpful.
:::

Additional figures and graphics are also welcome - you are encouraged to make your notebooks as engaging and visually interesting as possible. 

Here are some links to potential data resources that you can use to develop your analyses:
