## Introduction

This end-of-day session is focused on using pandas for loading, visualizing, and analyzing marine microplastics data. This session is designed to help you become comfortable with the pandas library, equipping you with the skills needed to perform data analysis effectively.

The [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://noaa.gov/), via its [National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/) has an entire section related to marine microplastics -- that is, microplastics found in water â€” at [https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/microplastics](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/microplastics).

We will be working with a recent download of the entire marine microplastics dataset. The url for this data is located here:

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| include: true
url = 'https://ucsb.box.com/shared/static/dnnu59jsnkymup6o8aaovdywrtxiy3a9.csv'
```

**Objective:** Write your own notebook that contains a simple DataFrame exploration as well as some basic grouping, filtering, and aggregation, and visualization... all within the pandas library.

## 1. Loading the Data

**Objective**: Learn to load data into a pandas DataFrame and display the first few records.

### Task 1.1 Import the pandas library.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
```

### Task 1.2: Load the dataset into a dataframe named `df` from the provided URL into a pandas DataFrame. 

:::{.callout-tip}
I've already taken a look at this data set and noticed there was a column with sample date called `Date`. We can use the `parse_date` option of the `read_csv()` function to convert values in the `Dates` column of the csv into datetime objects in pandas while reading the file. 
:::

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| include: true

df = pd.read_csv(url, parse_dates=['Date'], date_format='%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p')
```

### Task 1.3: Display the first five rows of the DataFrame to get an initial understanding of the data structure.

```{python}
df.head()
```

## 2. Exploring the Data


### Task 2.1: Display summary statistics of the dataset to understand the central tendency and variability.

```{python}
# Display summary statistics of the dataset
summary_statistics = df.describe()
print(summary_statistics)
```


### Task 2.2: Check the data types of each column and identify if there are any missing values.

```{python}
# Check the data types of each column and identify missing values
df_info = df.info()
```

## 3. Grouping the Data

### Task 3.1: Create a groupby object called `oceans` that groups the data in df according to the value of the Oceans column.

```{python}
oceans = df.groupby(['Oceans'])
```

### Task 3.2: Determine the total number of Measurements taken from each Ocean.

```{python}
oceans['Measurement'].count()
```

### Task 3.3: Determine the aveage value of Measurement taken from each Ocean.

```{python}
oceans['Measurement'].mean()
```

## 4. Filtering the Data and Aggregating the data

### Task 4.1: Filter the data to a new df (called df2) that only contains rows where the Unit of measurement is `pieces/m3`

```{python}
df2 = df[df['Unit'] == 'pieces/m3']
```

### Task 4.2: Use the groupby and the max() command to determine the Maximum value of pieces/m3 measured for each Ocean

```{python}
df2.groupby(['Oceans'])['Measurement'].max()
```


## 5. Simple Plots in pandas

### Task 5.1: Make a histogram of the lattitude of every sample in your filtered dataframe using the DataFrame plot command.

```{python}
df2['Latitude'].hist()
```

### Task 5.2: Make a histogram of the values of Measurements in your filtered dataframe 

```{python}
df2['Measurement'].hist()
```

## Conclusion

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations, you're officially doing python data science! ðŸŽ‰

Be sure to save your notebook and add comments and reflections at the end of your notebook before heading out for the day.
